Jenkins offers two primary ways to define and run builds: FreeStyle Projects and Pipelines. Here's a breakdown of each:

## FreeStyle Builds

- Definition: Traditional, more straightforward type of Jenkins project.


- Configuration: Configured via the Jenkins user interface (UI). Each step of the build process (e.g., source code checkout, build, test, and deploy) is defined through the UI with different build steps.


- Flexibility: Limited flexibility. Suitable for simple, linear processes.


- Version Control: The job configuration is stored in Jenkins itself, not in version control.


- Extensibility: Supports many Jenkins plugins, but extending or modifying the build process is more challenging than in pipelines.


- Parallelism: Limited support for parallel execution; more difficult to implement than in pipelines.


- Use Case: Good for simple builds that don't require complex logic or parallelism.


## Pipelines

- Definition: A more modern and powerful way to define jobs as code, using Jenkinsfile.


- Configuration: Pipelines are defined using a Jenkinsfile, which is a text file that contains the pipeline definition in code, typically using Groovy.


- Flexibility: Highly flexible. Supports complex workflows, including branching, parallel execution, and conditional logic.


- Version Control: The Jenkinsfile is usually stored in the same version control system as your source code, allowing the build configuration to evolve alongside the code.


- Extensibility: Easy to extend and customize. Supports declarative and scripted syntaxes, enabling intricate build logic.


- Parallelism: Natively supports parallel execution and complex workflows.


- Use Case: Ideal for complex builds, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines. Suitable for teams adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.


## Comparison

- Ease of Use: FreeStyle projects are easier for beginners or simple builds, while Pipelines require more knowledge but offer much more power and flexibility.


- Maintenance: Pipelines are easier to maintain over time, especially when used in conjunction with version control.


- Scalability: Pipelines scale better with project complexity due to their support for features like parallelism and complex conditional logic.


## When to Use What?

- FreeStyle Builds: Use for small, simple projects or for initial prototyping.


- Pipelines: Use for more complex projects, especially when you need version control, complex logic, or parallel execution. Pipelines are also better suited for teams practicing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
